The chimpanzee trainer thingy from Mind Field, but implemented with arrow keys and C# console because why the fuck not

Yeah so, that's it. Build it in visual studio, the settings are in the .sln file.
The code is pretty much fully commented and (fairly) modular, so it shouldn't be hard to understand

Controls:
  - Arrow keys
  - Enter

For an in-depth explanation of how you should play this:
  - Select a game level. There are 3 examples and an advanced custom one
  - Try to memorize the numerals as fast as possible
  - Navigate the grid to where the numerals are hidden and select them in order 1-9
